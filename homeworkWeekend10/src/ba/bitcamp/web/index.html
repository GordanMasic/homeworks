						MEMPHIS: I AM LEARNING FROM ROONEY
					</h2>
			<div class="memphis">
					<p>
						Although Saturday’s 0-0 draw with Newcastle was frustrating, Memphis Depay continued to display his excellent potential and the Manchester United forward insists his development is being accelerated by the knowledge and experience of team-mate Wayne Rooney.
						<img src="http://i4.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article6112524.ece/ALTERNATES/s615/Manchester-United-v-San-Jose-Earthquakes.jpg">

						The 21-year-old Dutchman is widely regarded as one of the most exciting young players in all of European football, a reputation that Rooney had of course earned when he was a similar age.

						Rooney has since fulfilled his extraordinary potential by scoring 230 goals in 483 Reds appearances, winning five Premier League titles, the UEFA Champions League, FIFA Club World Cup and two League Cups during 10 seasons at United. Now, he’s helping Memphis to harness his own promise.

						“Wayne Rooney helps me a lot,” Memphis said after Saturday’s match. “He has a lot of experience. He already knows everything about the football world so if I have any questions I can ask him.”

						United dropped points for the first time this season in Saturday’s match with Newcastle, who did well to withstand heavy pressure throughout a difficult game at Old Trafford. Memphis was disappointed the Reds couldn’t make the breakthrough, but insists the performance was good.

						“It was frustrating,” the Dutch forward and new no.7 admitted afterwards. “We started great and sharp and we created some chances but didn't finish them off. In the second half we also created some more chances but again we didn't finish it so that was the frustration.

						“When you look back you have to say it was one of those days but we have to start finishing. But we have to look forward and train and be ready for Club Brugge on Wednesday.”

						Asked about the differences between playing in Holland and England, Memphis noted: “Opponents are more organised here. The Premier League is stronger than in Holland and everybody knows that. I could have finished a couple of chances but I didn't and I have to work on that.”
